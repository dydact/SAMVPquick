                 SiteAware: Revolutionizing In-Home Healthcare                 

SiteAware is on a mission to transform in-home healthcare through the power of 
computer vision and data analytics. We envision a future where healthcare      
providers can remotely monitor patients' well-being, track progress, and       
intervene proactively, all while ensuring patient privacy and security.        

Our platform leverages cutting-edge technology to analyze video streams from   
in-home cameras, extracting valuable insights about patients' activities,      
behaviors, and potential risks. This data empowers healthcare professionals to 
make informed decisions, personalize treatment plans, and ultimately improve   
patient outcomes.

 1 Video Input: Secure video streams from in-home cameras are ingested into the
   system.                                                                     
 2 Video Processing: AWS Rekognition Video analyzes the video streams in       
   real-time, detecting objects, activities, and faces.                        
 3 Data Storage and Analysis: Processed data is stored in DynamoDB and S3.     
   Kinesis Data Analytics and Athena are used for real-time and historical data
   analysis, respectively.                                                     
 4 Alerts and Notifications: The system generates alerts and notifications     
   based on predefined rules and detected anomalies.                           
 5 User Interface: Healthcare professionals access a user-friendly dashboard to
   monitor patient data, receive alerts, and manage treatment plans.           

Key Features:
